If you don't know me, I'm a self-taught programmer who recently graduated with a business degree. My current goal is to break into tech and land a software development job. To accomplish this, I knew I had to become technically proficient. I had to work really hard, especially as an international student with a business background, where the job market tends to favor locals with relevant degrees (nervous laugh). So, I studied diligently every single day to gain a competitive edge. This required significant isolation, which was further intensified by my independent nature and reluctance to ask for assistance.

I was convinced that honing my technical skills would eventually pay off, not realizing that the self-imposed isolation was warping my perceptions and filling my mind with biases. I neglected the outside world, believing that my learning path to the tech industry was the only viable one.

While I recognized the importance of networking, I neglected it after failing to fit into tech groups. The groups at my non-prestigious university were solely focused on their curriculums, while those at prestigious universities were more concerned about getting internships in big corporations and had a weird obsession with solving leetcode problems. Corporate groups didn't seem interested in connecting with a novice like me who had skill issues. Therefore, I had become better. I had to become someone who **has something to sell,** otherwise, there was no point in networking. It sounds controversial, but that was the only truth to me.

So, aside from studying business at my university, I spend a significant amount of time dedicated to improving my programming skills. It was confirmed for me that I'm not naturally talented and smart, as learning new concepts in programming didn't feel like a breeze. But that did not stop me from continuously learning. My goal was clear and I never got distracted from it.

After some time, I could finally tell that I had obtained the technical skills I sought. I was able to solve most of the d&a problems, and built some cool and impressive side-projects. But at what cost? At the cost of having no network and no connections in the industry. Now, instead of employers having a hint of my skill level by having connections or referrals, they had to take a gamble on me - a risk they are often unwilling to take with the applicants. All the hard work left me with nothing but technical skill, which does not necessarily put me over other candidates.

But it's not over yet. I recently graduated and, surprisingly, instead of feeling anxious about my future, I feel calm, collected, and confident. While I will be hunting for job positions, this break from extensive technical skill development will allow me to focus on writing, opening new avenues for growth. It's not all about your knowledge, the ability to code programs, and solve various algorithm and data structure problems. The ability to gather your knowledge, organize it, and then articulate it coherently on paper or verbally is what makes you a highly desirable and valuable asset to a company. 

As for making connections, this is something I'm currently finding challenging, but I plan to address it by writing more and reaching out to as many people as possible.
