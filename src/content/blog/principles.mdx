Everyone should have clearly defined principles to live by. Principles is what make us sane, organised, and prevent us from making impactful blunders in life. Here I will share my 3 principles, that helped me to become a morally good, rational, and mentally healthy human being.

### Having growth mindset.

This should come as no surprise. We should always seek more knowledge and develop new skills to become highly competent and useful to society. What's the point of being useless and complacent? The world doesn't need weak and incompetent people, as they create tough times for new generations. Every problem is solvable, every skill issue is fixable; all you need is time, determination, and focus. This mindset is easier to obtain by surrounding yourself with people who are better than you or have the same passion and determination. You should also note that you are never superior to others just because you have more knowledge on something. Every person has unique experiences that you can learn from.

### Don’t do things for the sake of pleasure.

Sex, drugs, alcohol, and parties can be fun and pleasurable. However, it's important not to sacrifice things that are important to you for the sake of momentary satisfaction. As human beings, we are distinguished from other animals by our ability to suppress our instincts for a greater cause. You have full control of your mind and body; you hold the controller in this game of life. Be mindful, rational, and responsible for every action you take. Otherwise, you may make blunders and live the rest of your life full of regrets.

### All of us are delusional. Recognise it and take control of it.

Being delusional means holding a strong conviction or belief that may be faulty. A common source of delusion arises from selective bias, when a person believes that if X has achieved a successful outcome by doing Y actions, then they can achieve the same outcome by following Y. While that may sometimes be the case, there are always hidden, intricate factors that may not always play in your favor.

I've seen many people quit their jobs based on the belief that they have a revolutionary idea that will allow them to live a luxurious life. While this can occasionally lead to success, in most cases it results in disappointment and financial hardship. Take only calculated risks and view everything from worst-case scenario perspectives. The concepts of selective bias, survivorship bias, and confirmation bias are useful in snapping you out of delusional thinking and bringing you back to reality. You should always have a plan B, but if you don't, make sure that the failed outcome of plan A doesn't have catastrophic consequences. 

It’s good to define many principles for yourself, but defining a few unbreakable ones will be more powerful, effective, and easier to internalise.
