Isolation can often lead to self-reflection and self-awareness. Spending time away from your usual surroundings, friends, and loved ones provides an opportunity to reflect on your identity and your roles as a friend, colleague, and human being. Many of us are hesitant to take time for ourselves, as our minds are typically preoccupied with work, social life, and education. However, isolation isn't just beneficial for self-reflection. It can also be instrumental in accomplishing tasks such as meeting project deadlines, writing a book, or training in martial arts. The path to success often requires periods of solitude.

That said, isolation should not be perpetual. Extended periods of being alone can lead to significant detriments and potentially self-destruction. You may feel that your mind becomes foggy and blank, you may start forgetting important things quickly as your focus narrows down to a specific task you're currently undertaking in isolation. You may also see that your relationship with your close ones is deteriorating, as you're not spending enough time with them. It will eventually hurt your mental, and if you are mentally weak, it will break you.

It’s essential to reconnect with the outside world periodically, engaging in conversations with family, friends, and co-workers. Their perspectives and critiques can snap you out of any delusional thinking that may arise from prolonged isolation. They also provide essential support, enabling you to continue working and striving for greatness. Don’t be isolated for long, go outside, take a deep breath of fresh air and start to see the world in its entirety.
